<p>When I was young man, <span class="highlight">I remember seeing some of the greatest air guitarists in the world perform</span> on stage in my small town of Lindon, TN. That was back when candy bars were a $0.35 a piece and gas was under a dollar a gallon &mdash; those were the golden years of the art known as the air guitar.</p>

<p>I remember seeing these pros and asking myself <em class="highlight">“How do they do such greatness without a guitar in hand?”</em> I would practice hours upon hours each day, month after month, year after year. Yes, I would get better, but I still was lacking something and I could not quite “put my finger on it”, per say.</p>

<p>That is until I came across a good friend of mine from our youth, Gary. We had spent many hours together, jamming away on our air guitars up until he had moved from out of the state. A few years later, here we were standing in line at the local grocery store when he asked me how my playing was going.</p>

<p>I told Gary that <span class="highlight">I had hit a rut and couldn't quite get out of it</span>. I'll never forget what he told me. He said, “Lawrence, you've got talent &mdash; I've seen you rock it like it's nobody's business. But, <span class="highlight">you are missing the key ingredient: <em class="red">cliche</em>. To be <em>different</em> from everybody else, you have to <em class="red">truly try to be like everybody else</em>.</span>”</p>



<h3 id="that-was-it">That was it!</h3>



<h4 id="youve-got-to-be-cliche-to-standout"><span class="highlight">You've got to be <em class="red">cliche</em> to standout!</span></h4>



<h4 id="this-made-all-the-difference-but-there-was-still-more">This made all the difference, but there was still more…</h4>

<p>After our reunion, I went home and practiced and practiced. After 3 months of trial and error, I unlocked the secrets and quickly found where this could take me. Being <em>cliche</em> certainly was the the tipping ingredient that got me on the right path, but there still was <em>so</em> much more…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We would be nowhere without <em>Air Guitar Masters</em>. We started in a garage with little more than twiddling fingers &mdash; no sound at all. But with <em>AGM</em> we learned a totally non-heinous way to rock and totally discovered our sound.” <br>

<h4 id="and-lets-not-forget-wayne">and let’s not forget Wayne:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Air Guitar Masters</em> is what taught me how to party on and be excellent. My TV show would have been little more than a few extreme close ups of me and Garth. In fact, I would have never achieved the excellence of “No Stairway”. I owe everything to <em>AGM</em>.” <br>
